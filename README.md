JavaScript GIF Viewer for Windows 

It was last in Windows XP that Windows Picture and Fax Viewer displayed moving GIFs. Microsoft has removed this support from its picture viewers on later OS viz. Vista, 7 and 8. 
Thankfully, most modern browsers support GIF and IE is one of them.

This is my humble attempt to leverage the power of JavaScript to enable viewing GIFs on Windows without using any third-party apps.
Just run the latest **Jifer.html** and paste the directory path in the text box. Click **Find GIFs** and navigate using **Previous** and **Next** buttons.
